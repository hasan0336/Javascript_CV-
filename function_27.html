	<!--The Lifetime Supply Calculator
Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack
is? Wonder no more!
Write a function named calculateSupply that:
o takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
o calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a
constant max age).
o outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last
you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each
time.
Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and
round the result to a round number. -->
